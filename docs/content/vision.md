All systems need observability. That starts with emitting telemetry data. 
But the raw data alone isn’t enough. There’s a set of steps - roughly: 
collect, transform, interpret, act - through which telemetry data passes 
that are necessary for software to be not merely observable, but observed
by real, actual humans. These steps are performed by an observability platform,
driven by the configuration of that platform.

Of course, as software evolves, so too must the configuration that allows it 
to be observed. By nature, software and its observers are companions. 
Today’s tooling, however, makes co-evolution of the two profoundly frictionful. 
That’s what we’re aiming to change - no matter how you ship software, your
observability can ride sidecar. Achieving this has the potential to make 
observability go mainstream, much as testing has over the last decade.
