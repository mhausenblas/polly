## Background

### What's the system under observation (SUO)?

<!-- 
e.g. etcd, kubernetes, ceph, linux node via Prometheus node exporter
-->

#### Link to the mixin you're migrating from (if applicable)

<!-- 

#### What kind of parameters do you think it makes sense for this pop to take? Why?

#### How did you decide whether it was worth making particular queries into reusable signals?

#### Which part of the polly spec was most confusing to work with? If you figured it out, what did you see that helpd you figure it out?

#### Is there anything about observing the SUO that the polly schema did not allow you to express in the pop?
